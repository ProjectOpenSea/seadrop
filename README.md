## Background

SeaDrop is a protocol to perform primary drops on evm-compatible blockchains. The types of drops supported are public drops, allow list stages, and server-side signed mints.

SeaDrop v2 tokens are [Seaport][seaport-link] contract offerers. Mints are executed by fulfilling Seaport orders with `OrderType.CONTRACT`.

## Install

To install dependencies and compile contracts:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/seadrop && cd seadrop
yarn install
yarn build
```

## Usage

To run hardhat tests written in javascript:

```bash
yarn test
yarn coverage
```

To profile gas usage:

```bash
yarn profile
```

### Foundry Tests

SeaDrop also includes a suite of fuzzing tests written in solidity with Foundry.

To install Foundry (assuming a Linux or macOS system):

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

This will download foundryup. To start Foundry, run:

```bash
foundryup
```

To install dependencies:

```
forge install
```

To build the contracts:

```
yarn build:foundry
```

To run tests:

```
forge test
```

To run gas snapshot:

```
forge snapshot
```

The following modifiers are also available:

- Level 2 (-vv): Logs emitted during tests are also displayed.
- Level 3 (-vvv): Stack traces for failing tests are also displayed.
- Level 4 (-vvvv): Stack traces for all tests are displayed, and setup traces for failing tests are displayed.
- Level 5 (-vvvvv): Stack traces and setup traces are always displayed.

```bash
forge test  -vv
```

For more information on foundry testing and use, see [Foundry Book installation instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).

To run lint checks:

```bash
yarn lint:check
```

Lint checks utilize prettier, prettier-plugin-solidity, and solhint.

```javascript
"prettier": "^2.5.1",
"prettier-plugin-solidity": "^1.0.0-beta.24",
```

## Audits

SeaDrop was audited after development by [Spearbit](https://spearbit.com/), read the report [here](./assets/spearbit-seadrop-audit.pdf).

## Contributing

Contributions to SeaDrop are welcome by anyone interested in writing more tests, improving readability, optimizing for gas efficiency, or extending the protocol with new features.

When making a pull request, ensure that:

- All tests pass.
- Code coverage remains at 100% (coverage tests must currently be written in hardhat).
- All new code adheres to the style guide:
  - All lint checks pass.
  - Code is thoroughly commented with natspec where relevant.
- If making a change to the contracts:
  - Gas snapshots are provided and demonstrate an improvement (or an acceptable deficit given other improvements).
  - Reference contracts are modified correspondingly if relevant.
  - New tests (ideally via foundry) are included for all new features or code paths.
- If making a modification to third-party dependencies, `yarn audit` passes.
- A descriptive summary of the PR has been provided.
